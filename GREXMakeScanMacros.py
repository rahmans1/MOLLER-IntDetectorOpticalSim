#This script produces a series of G4 macros that vary a specified set of simulation parameters that are of relevance to the MOLLER detector design.
#This script will also produce a bash script at the end, called "StartRuns" that can be used to run all of the generated macros at the same time.
#Care should be taken with respect to the number of variations. Each simulation run takes about 1GB of memory. On my own machine with 20 cores and 15 GB Memory + 15 GB Swap
#I can comfortably run about 20 such processes at a time.
